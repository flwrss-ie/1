            Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat in healthcare as it is predicted to cause 10 million deaths per year by 2050. 
            Thus it is important to find pharmaceutical/ laboratory methods that focus on- mechanism of action, to combat AMR. 
            The bacterial DNA repair and SOS response promote survival of pathogens in infection and also activate hypermutation and resistance mechanisms, making these pathways attractive targets for new therapeutics. 
            Researchers at Ineos Oxford Institute for antimicrobial research (IOI) and Department of Pharmacology at Oxford University have discovered a small molecule ‘OXF-077’ that could suppress the antibiotic resistance thereby combating AMR.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bacteria contain antibiotic resistance genes which enable them to survive and proliferate in presence of environment with specific antibiotics that could normally inhibit the growth of bacteria or could kill them. A way bacteria become resistant to antibiotics is due to mutations in genetic code. Some antibiotics work by damaging the DNA causing cells to die. 
            DNA damage in bacterial genome can result from oxidative burst generated by neutrophils during infection or by treatment with antibiotics such as quinolones, which induce DNA double stranded breaks (DSBs).
        </p>
        <p>
            However, this DNA damage can trigger SOS response in affected bacteria. This SOS response repairs damaged DNA in bacteria and increases the rate of genetic mutations which also lead to development of resistance to antibiotics. Therefore, suppression of SOS response is important in order to increase the effectiveness of antibiotics against bacteria. Small molecules like, IMP-1700, damage DNA and inhibit SOS response mechanism in methicillin resistant S. aureus. But, it’s structure activity relationship was not explored much. 
            Thus, understanding the mechanism of action (MOA) and structure activity relationship (SAR) is important to develop new molecules to address challenges regarding AMR.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are certain enzyme complexes present in bacteria, AddAB for Gram-positive bacteria and RecBCD for Gram-negative bacteria. 
            These are ATP dependent helicase nucleases that process DNA using complex biochemical pathways, producing 3’ single-stranded DNA as a final product. 
            Thus, loss of AddAB/RecBCD activity increases the efficiency of DNA-damaging quinolone antibiotics, like ciprofloxacin (CFX). 
            AddAB/RecBCD inhibitors can also promote immune clearance of infections by host immune response. 
            The researchers at Oxford have demonstrated the potent inhibition of SOS response through comparing its SAR and MOA with other small molecules like ML-328, IMP-1700, OXF-077. 
            It was found that ML-328 was identified by high-throughput screening against E. coli growth in the presence of T4 gene 2 mutant phage, whose survival is blocked by RecBCD activity. OXF-077 suppresses the rate of CFX resistant emergence in S. aureus, thereby combating AMR. 
            Their SAR exploration proved that OXF-007 as new best performing compound that could be valuable tool molecule for future development as it reduced the CFX resistance evolution in S.aureus.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the first study done to demonstrate that an inhibitor of SOS response can suppress evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria through focusing on mechanism of action and structure activity relationship.
